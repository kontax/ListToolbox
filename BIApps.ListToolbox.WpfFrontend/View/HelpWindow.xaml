                                Splitting lists is used to split a list into multiple smaller lists based on 
                                a specified criteria, either by a distinct column or a number of rows. For 
                                example, if you had a list of customers and their platform preference in a list 
                                (eg. Mobile, Desktop, Both), then splitting the list by the platform preference 
                                column would result in three outputted lists (one for each platform preference).

                                Alternatively you may need to limit a list to a specific number of rows (eg. due 
                                to an upload limit). In order to do this you select Row Count, and choose to 
                                either keep or remove headers from the output files. You then enter the maximum 
                                number of rows you want for each output file, and the lists will split with no 
                                more than that number.

                                        Duplicates function within Excel.

                                This function checks a list(s) of customers to see if they are able to be 
                                contacted based on specific criteria selected by the user. For example, if you 
                                have list of customers you want to email, but the list is a few days old, then 
                                you use this function to ensure the customers still have the flags set to be 
                                allowed to be contacted.

                                        the column you've uploaded in the list. For example, the uploaded list 
                                        may have a cust_id column within it. This matches up to the ppo_cust_id 
                                        column in the database, so ppo_cust_id should be selected as the Join

                                        whereas Flag just adds a column to the end of the output list outlining

                                The Explorer Context Menu adds limited functionality of the application to the 
                                right click menu in Windows Explorer. This means that you will not have to open 
                                the application and upload the lists manually, instead you just need to right 
                                click on them and choose the associated function from within Windows Explorer. 
                                The functionality has some limitations which are described in the Usage section 
                                below, so please take note of them first.

                                        The lists will then be uploaded and deduped as described in the DeDupe

                                        one of the necessary customer identifiers (eg. Username/Cust ID). If it 
                                        does not then the contact checking will fail. Only one method of 
                                        contactibility can be check against at any one time.
